IDL AND FORTRAN ROUTINES FOR CALCULATING THE CLUSTER FORMATION EFFICIENCY
=========================================================================


Contents
========

CFE_Fortran.tar.gz: 
    The archive contains six files.
    - f_cfe.f90: module containing functions for calculating the CFE as a
      function of galaxy-scale observables.
    - f_cfelocal.f90: module containing functions for calculating the CFE 
      as a function of local quantities.
    - parameters.in: text file containing the adjustable model parameters.
    - testCFE.f90: example test program to calculate the CFE in the solar 
      neighbourhood using galaxy-scale observables as input.
    - testCFElocal.f90: example test program to calculate the CFE in the solar 
      neighbourhood using local quantities as input.
    - This README.
    See the header of either f_cfe.f90 or f_cfelocal.f90 for a more detailed 
    explanation.

CFE_IDL.tar.gz: 
    The archive contains three files.
    - f_cfe.pro: contains functions for calculating the CFE as a function of
      galaxy-scale observables.
    - f_cfelocal.pro: contains functions for calculating the CFE as a function
      of local quantities.
    - This README.
    See the header of either f_cfe.pro or f_cfelocal.pro for a more detailed 
    explanation.


Installation
============

Fortran:
    The functions are provided in a module and therefore cannot be used as
    stand-alone tools. In order to function properly, the module and its
    functions need to be called from the program they are used in. Example
    programs are provided in testCFE.f90 and testCFElocal.f90 for the galaxy-
    scale and local formulations of the model, respectively. These examples are
    also shown in the headers of f_cfe.f90 and f_cfelocal.f90.

IDL: 
    The function files need to be located in the working directory, or in some
    other location specified in your IDL_PATH. They can then be called as
    detailed in the headers of f_cfe.pro and f_cfelocal.pro.

Python:
    Use f2py:
    f2py -c -m cfeglobal f_cfe.f90
    f2py -c -m cfelocal f_cfelocal.f90


Terms of Use
============

These routines are free software and come without any warranty. If you use these 
routines while preparing a paper or talk, the author would appreciate it if you
cite the paper in which the CFE model was presented:
